Finding DC approximate solution failed. Try again with try_fast_op set to no.
Matrix is singular (detected at `I2.I28.I19.gnd!').
Trying `homotopy = gmin' for initial conditions.

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
