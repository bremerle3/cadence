*************************************************
Transient Analysis `tran': time = (0 s -> 3.6 us)
*************************************************
Trying `homotopy = gmin' for initial conditions.

Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(I0.594) = 167.765 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
